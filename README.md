# Portfolio

Hi, I'm Chel. Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.  

I'm a Test Engineer that's passionate about front-end and back-end testing and automation. My current tech stack includes:  

🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript - for understanding and validating front-end behavior  
🧪 Postman - for testing and automating RESTful APIs  
🧭 Cypress - for writing robust end-to-end UI test scripts  
🗄️ SQL - for verifying data integrity and querying databases during testing  

Here you'll find my personal projects: test strategy, test plans, test cases, test reports and automation scripts that showcase my commitment to quality, clean code, and continuous learning.
